## 3. Metrics Fundamentals

Understanding and working with metrics is crucial for data-driven decision making and forecasting:

### Differentiating Types of Metrics
- **Acquisition Metrics**: How users discover and start using your product (e.g., conversion rates, cost per acquisition)
- **Activation Metrics**: How users have their first positive experience (e.g., time to value, onboarding completion rate)
- **Retention Metrics**: How users continue to engage over time (e.g., churn rate, customer lifetime value)
- **Revenue Metrics**: How the product generates income (e.g., average revenue per user, monthly recurring revenue)
- **Referral Metrics**: How users promote the product to others (e.g., net promoter score, viral coefficient)

### Identifying Characteristics of Good Metrics
- **Meaningful**: Tied to business goals and actionable
- **Measurable**: Can be accurately and consistently quantified
- **Understandable**: Easy to interpret and explain to stakeholders
- **Timely**: Can be measured and acted upon quickly

### Defining North Star and Guardrail Metrics
- **North Star Metric**: The single metric that best captures the core value of your product
  - Examples: Daily Active Users (Facebook), Weekly Engaged Users (Slack)
- **Guardrail Metrics**: Metrics that ensure other important aspects aren't neglected while optimizing for the North Star
  - Examples: Customer Satisfaction Score, Error Rate

### Avoiding Vanity Metrics by Focusing on Actionable Insights
- Identify metrics that look good but don't drive decisions (e.g., total registered users)
- Focus on metrics that provide insights leading to concrete actions
- Understand the difference between vanity metrics and truly valuable data
- Always ask: "What decision or action will this metric inform?"
